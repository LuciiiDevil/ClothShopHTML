    HTML5: Used for semantic markup, ensuring a clean and structured document flow.

    CSS3: Utilized for styling (style.css), creating the layout (likely using Flexbox or Grid for the .row and .col-* classes), and achieving the modern, professional aesthetic.

    External Font: Integration of Google Fonts (Poppins) for clear and modern typography.

    Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
